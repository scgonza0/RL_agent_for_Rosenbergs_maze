# RL_agent_for_Rosenbergs_maze
During the Neuromatch Academy-Deep-Learning 2021 course we made a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent capable of exploring Rosenberg's maze (1).

For this we use the Open-AI gym toolkit and design our agent and environment based on the Taxi-v3 example(2).

All the codes were run in google colab

The code is separated into 4 parts: definition of the environment, call to the environment, Q-learning and testing.

The agent and the environment was planned by Julieta Millán, Santiago Cordisco Gonzalez, Danilo Trinidad and Diana Vergara. 

The implementation, execution and debugging was done by Julieta Millán, Santiago Cordisco Gonzalez and Diana Vergara.
